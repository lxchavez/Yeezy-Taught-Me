    "\n",
    "Although Kanye West is confident that he is the greatest artist of all time, there are many (haters) in the media with various opinions regarding his claim. Can the success of today‚Äôs popular hip-hop artists be attributed to the previous work of Kanye?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Determine if audio features and lyrics from the songs of recent hip-hop artists active between 2004-2010 were influenced by Kanye using data from The Million Song Dataset and musiXmatch.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Kanye West is not the biggest influencer, or even a major one, then who is and who are they grouped with?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Artists who were influenced by Kanye West‚Äôs work will have songs with similar audio features (e.g. acousticness, danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness, etc.) to that of Kanye.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/images/jcole.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\" alt=\"J. Cole on Kanye West\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Artists like J. Cole and Drake have attributed their success to Kanye for allowing them to breaking into the hip hop industry that was largely dominated by gangsta rap in the 90's to late 00's.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact and Motivation üî•üî•üî•\n",
    "\n",
    "Many who know me well are intrigued to learn that I am *slightly* obsessed with Kanye West. Yeah, I can understand that his public persona can come off as being an asshole and all - but he makes good music tho and is arguably among the greatest hip hop artists and producers in the industry. At least that is what this project will try to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is for all the Ye Stans out there. Even if the data shows that he is not as influential as I perceive him to be, then it will be a fun topic to at least explore. It's an itch that needs to be scratched.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will also show who has been influential in the rap game and which artists tend to cluster together in terms of musical tastes and similarity. This project will attempt to yield quantitative data to qualitative questions, and the opinions and perceptions of the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Can Machine Learning Be Useful? ü§ñ\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding out how influential Ye is can be accomplished by grouping similar artists together through a common set of features ranking them in order of similarity. Assuming that is how we go about finding Kanye's influence score/rank, an **unsupervised learning** algorithm can be employed to accomplish this goal. More specifically - a clustering algorithm that takes features of a song into account like tempo, bass, instrument-to-speech ratio, duration, etc.\n",

    "In lieu of having experience in the music or entertainment industry I have decided to look elsewhere first and see what attempts others have made to extract trends in music through the use of data.\n",

    "- [Who Needs Genres When There is Data?](http://www.decibelsanddecimals.com/dbdblog/2016/6/13/spotify-related-artists) Brady Fowler of *Decibels & Decimals* uses network theory to discover related artists through Spotify user listening data. Fowler generated a graph to indicate how artists fit together and argues that they can grouped by similarity as opposed to a genre. What if Kanye started his own subgenre of hip hop?\n",
    "- [Sound Predictions: How the audio properties of a track lead to sales?](https://www.nextbigsound.com/labs/echonest) The audio properties of a track can predict sales with 63% accuracy using only the audio properties of a song. Can we predict how similar a newer song is to Kanye's older songs and use this as a measure of similarity?\n",
    "- [Music Anatomy 201: Predicting Sales](https://github.com/eric-czech/portfolio/tree/master/demonstrative/R/music_anatomy) Eric Czech's R code and analysis that compares iTunes sales data to audio features. Can we use the same dataset and song features to cluster related hip hop artists?\n",
    "- [The Most Successful Labels in Hip Hop](http://poly-graph.co/labels/) Matt Daniels' analysis surfaces notable labels in hip hop's history (starting from 1989) by measuring each label by its artists chart performance on Billboard. I would like to incorporate Daniel's visualization into my project given time to compare clusters of artists by their similarity (i.e. influence) of a major player. His analysis also has me wondering if the label of an artist has any relation to the influence of said artist; think Aftermath with Dr. Dre and Eminem or Top Dawg Entertainment with Kendrick Lamar.\n",

    "## Potential Methods and Models üìèüîÆüéØ\n",
    "\n",
    "- **k-means/DBSCAN clustering algorithms:** use a clustering algorithm on audio features of songs to group similar artists, and presumably genres, together\n",
    "- **Logistic regression:** iterate over an artist‚Äôs catalog and calculate the probability of an artist sounding like Ye\n",
    "- **Natural language processing (NLP):** use the \"bag-of-words\" method on song lyrics where the (frequency of) occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier\n",
    "- **[Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)](http://www.tfidf.com/):** use to retrieve similar documents (lyrics) together. In addition to dope beats, the lyrics are what make a song lit (dolla, dolla bill y'all)!\n",

    "[**The Million Song Dataset:**](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular tracks based on the now deprecated Echo Nest API. The dataset was created in December 2010. The accompanying **musiXmatch** dataset provides lyrics for the Million Song Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Spotify API**:](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-several-audio-features/) Spotify acquired Echo Nest in 2014. Spotify‚Äôs Tracks API endpoint provides many of the same audio features found on The Million Song Dataset for the entire Spotify music catalog. Additional observations might have to be collected from this API to include more hip-hop artists and more recent artists that have emerged since 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Genius API:**](https://docs.genius.com/) provides community generated lyrics for songs. Lyrics might need to be scraped from the site and merged with metadata from the API to accompany new song observations fetched from Spotify.\n",

    "1. Are clustering algorithms the best way to tackle this project? Should I try a mixture of linear regression and classification?\n",
    "1. What are some good algorithms to rank/score similarity? Will PageRank be sufficient?\n",
    "1. How many songs will I need to analyze to be statistically significant?\n",
    "1. Can I get away with random sampling?\n",
    "1. If lyrics are taken into account as an additional set of features, do the similarity of lyrics indicate influence?\n",
    "1. What if rap (or your favorite genre) music really \"sounds the same\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming that Kanye West has been an influential artist and producer\n",
    "- Assuming that since the intro of Kanye West, a subgenre of hip hop has emerged that is distinct from previous hip hop trends\n",
    "- Will count songs from other artists that Ye has been featured in or produced for as part of his sphere of influence\n",
    "- Assuming that the Million Song Dataset has significant amount of hip hop observations\n",
    "- Rappers have been known to quote lines or perform a play of words on a line as a shout-out or diss\n",
    "- Assuming that an unsupervised learning clustering algorithm would be the best way to tackle this problem\n",
    "- Presumably not accounting for underground artists, groups, and indie labels\n",
    "- Taking time series into account with this analysis; e.g. to see if \"The College Dropout\" and \"Late Registration\" had artists introduce similar sounding music\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks and Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- Audio and lyrical features might not actually show any significant differences\n",
    "- The Million Song Dataset might not contain enough observations for hip hop or Kanye. In this case I will end up using the Spotify API to (politely) collect relevant data\n",
    "- We might end up comparing producers and ghostwriters with each other, not necessarily the induvial artists themselves. This inherent bias may skew our results\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/images/ok.gif\" style=\"height: 250px;\" alt=\"OK OK OK OK OK\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- I expect my output to be a table of artists and an influence/similarity score of related artists under\n",
    "- My target audience would instead prefer to see easily digestible visualizations - graphs with color coded clusters, a similarity/ranking table where they can enter their own artist, audio samples or comparisons to make the case that Ye has been influential\n",
    "- Project will be considered a success if a cluster of artists is identified for each one of Ye's album releases. As long as it's statistically significant and there are a handful of well-known artists that have been influenced, like J. Cole or Drake\n",
    "- Model might be relatively simple if I only take audio features or song lyrics and metadata into account. Model might become more complex if I include both sets of features, but might be necessary as music is as much about the lyrics as dope beats\n"
