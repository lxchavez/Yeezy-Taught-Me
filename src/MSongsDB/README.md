************************************************************
+ The dataset contains the analysis and metadata for a million songs.
The goal is to provide a large dataset for researchers to report results 
on, hence encouraging algorithms that scale to commercial sizes.

+ Most of the information is provided by The Echo Nest.
The dataset is the result of a collaboration between The Echo Nest
and LabROSA at Columbia University.
This project is funded in part by the NSF.

+ Most of the data is licensed the same way as Echo Nest's API.</br>
